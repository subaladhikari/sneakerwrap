## Development
While building projects for my portfolio, I thought that everyone else would have the same ecommerce site with same app mechanism. I decided to create a sneaker company site instead that has/will have all the functionality of an ecommerce site and more. As a freelancer, I built a template website for a client through Reddit, which I then used to create this sneaker wrap website.
